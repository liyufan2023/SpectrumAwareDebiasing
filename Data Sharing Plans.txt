# Data Sharing Plans

This repo shares implementation code and data used for numerical experiments for the paper SPECTRUM-AWARE DEBIASING: A MODERN INFERENCE FRAMEWORK
WITH APPLICATIONS TO PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS REGRESSION, available on arxiv https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07810. The implementation code and instructions for running the code for reproduction is enclosed in a Jupyter Notebook code.ipynb. 

The data we used in this study to demonstrate our methodology are all in the public domain, extracted from (i) UCI Machine Learning Repository, (ii) OpenML and (iii) Scikit-Learn's real data repository. We include the data files in a zip file (data.zip). We also cite the studies that originally published these data in Section 3.C and provide more information in Section 9.A of the Supplementary Information Appendix. 

For readers' convenience, we also make the notebook accessible through the Google Colaboratory:
